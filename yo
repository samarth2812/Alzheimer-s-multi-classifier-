 Why .eml and .msg don't work in browser preview:
.eml (RFC822) files are raw email files. They include headers, MIME parts, and potentially embedded attachments.

.msg (Outlook) files are a proprietary Microsoft binary format.

Browsers:

Donâ€™t have native renderers for these file types.

Will always download them because there's no MIME type handler.
