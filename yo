Element implicitly has an 'any' type because expression of type 'string' can't be used to index type '{ readonly COMPLIANCE_MAKER: 0; readonly COMPLIANCE_CHECKER: 1; readonly DEPARTMENT_MAKER: 2; readonly DEPARTMENT_CHECKER: 3; }'.
  No index signature with a parameter of type 'string' was found on type '{ readonly COMPLIANCE_MAKER: 0; readonly COMPLIANCE_CHECKER: 1; readonly DEPARTMENT_MAKER: 2; readonly DEPARTMENT_CHECKER: 3; }'.
